### Fractional Reserve

Banks only keep a fraction of the money deposited in the reserve while investing the rest into the money markets.

## Interest Rates

- Interest: A fee for the use of money
- Interest rate: A percentage of the loan or deposit that is charged as interest
- APR: Annual percentage of rate of interest

## Banks - Monetary Policy
Retail banks can set their own rate for lending money to their clients. But the rate to lend between banks is set by the Central bank

- **LIBOR**: London Interbank Offered Rate was a benchmark interest rate for short-term loans between banks. But it has been abolished and been replaced by **Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR)**

## Central Banks - Interest and Inflation
 **Interest Rates**: The percentage of principal charged by the lender for the use of its money.
 **Inflation**: A quantitative measure of how much the average price for selected goods and services will rise over time. Shows a decrease in the purchasing power of a nation's currency. Measured by CPI and PPI.
 - CPI: Consumer price Index
 - PPI: Producer Price Index
 The central bank can make changes to affect the inflation rate.
 - Increase Inflation = More Spending + Lower Interest Rates
 - Decrease Inflation = Less Spending + Increase Interest Rate

### Impact of higher interest rates
High interest rates = higher exchange rates (more demand for the currency aborad), to help reduce inflationary pressure by:
- Making Imports cheaper(lower price of imported goods)
- Reduce demand for export and increase incentive to cut cost for export.

## Quantitative Easing (QE)
New money is created electronically and is used to purchase Goverment Bonds or other assets. Increased bond prices, reduce yield and encourages money to be invested elsewhere e.g borrowing.
- More money supply = lower cost of borrowing
- Used when inflation and interest are very low and need boosting through spending.
